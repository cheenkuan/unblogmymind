I recently completed the [FinTechSG](https://fintechlab.nus.edu.sg/nus-fintechsg-programme/) Programme run by the NUS School of Computing FinTech Lab and wanted to share some thoughts on the course from the perspective of a mid-career student. 

The entire course was conducted remotely via Zoom over two months. No one will expect otherwise in 2020. I only brought it up because I wanted to use one of my zoom virtual backgrounds with the NUS School of Computing FinTech Lab banner inserted for context as my feature image for this post. If NUS prefers that I do not use the banner, please contact me, and I will discreetly make appropriate editorial changes.

### What was Promised?

A structured two-month intensive full-time course on the fundamentals of FinTech and business, subsequent programming concepts, as well as knowledge and development tools used in the FinTech industry.

### What was delivered?

The programme was structured, delivered all the fundamentals of FinTech and business at a level which will benefit novices, and took us through many programming concepts and development tools. On the other hand, they may have been modest about the intensity.

### Will a non-technical mid-career be able to complete the course?

I have not received my certification yet, but am confident that I will. This confidence is borne out of my believe that I was able to demonstrate through participation that I have learnt the concepts and skills the programme developers sought to impart. When we stumbled, there were consultation sessions with lecturers to help us get past the block. 

### Areas for Improvement?

The FinTechSG Programme has a very wide coverage designed for a very diverse audience conducted within a relatively short time. For this reason, I believe the programme will be open to many diverse criticims resulting from a participant's existing knowledge and background. Too shallow, too much depth, too technical, not technical enough, too theoretical, too practical, etc. Based on what I have heard and reflecting on the design of the programme and it's goal, I think it may be just right.

### Am I ready to be a professional in the FinTech Industry?

That was clearly not the promise. What we learnt was enough to get us started on the journey of self discovery on suitability, area for specialisation, and path for further professional development in pursuit of the goal of becoming a FinTech professional. It takes dedication, passion and opportunity to get there. If you bring the dedication and passion, the course even provides you the opportunity in the form of full time traineeship with leading financial institutions and companies. 

Incidentally, what I learnt was also enough for me to create a modest product like this platform ... and other interesting things, which I hope to showcase soon.

### Thoughts for the FinTech Industry

Although the programme admitted and even encouraged mid-careers to participate, the entry path for mid-careers into the FinTech industry is less obvious and should receive more consideration by  industry. Personally, I feel this is a missed opportunity for the industry. 

During the programme, it was clear that mid-careers demonstrated just as much dedication and passion as recent graduands or graduates. They were also not lacking in their abilities or quality of their work. In most cases, they have more than 15 years before retirement age, plenty of time to achieve a lot in fast-moving FinTech, especially if they carry the attitude that they have to make up for lost time. Moreover, mid-careers may provide a positive balance to FinTech teams for the previous experiences they bring to the table. 

Singapore's FinTech ambition requires a much bigger talent pool than exists here. As importing all the required talent may not be a desirable option, I believe that increasing the local pools from which talent is drawn into the industry is an important avenue that should be embraced by the industry as well as the Singapore government, in order to create the best environment for growth.

I will end this post with my current opensource inspired tagline, in the hopes that the FinTech community will embrace the inclusiveness of the opensource community.

#### Together we can achieve so much more.

Shout out to Keith Carter and Uli Hitzel, who inspired me to create this platform with the tools and skills they imparted.
