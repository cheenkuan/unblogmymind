Thank you for coming here.

Brief introduction. I am a lawyer based in Singapore who has been deeply immersed in the oil & gas industry for the past 15 years. I can be contacted via [Linkedin](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/cheen-kuan-au-3ab8413b) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cheenkuan). Link to my [GitHub](https://github.com/cheenkuan).

Recently, my interest in Tech and FinTech was nourished by the NUS FinTechSG Programme I undertook. This is a product of my continuing journey of discovery for Tech after the course.

I don't have a lot to say here at the moment. This is pretty much a work in progress. It is part of my journey of discovery into the use of technology and contemporary development tools.

As the tools I selected for the journey, GitHub, Gatsby and netlify, also makes developing websites accessible to people like me, I thought I should attempt to make my journey more enriching by using the product of my experiments as a channel for organising my thoughts and sharing them. This leads me to my new open source inspired tagline.

### Together, we can achieve so much more.

The open source tools that I am experimenting with are capable of doing so much more than my modest efforts can exhibit. In time to come, I expect to be able to harness more of their prowess and versatility, confident that I will be receiving plenty of help along the way from the Tech community.
